HaxeFlixel does not not support infinite tilemaps
Use a finite tilemap size instead.

Although TiledMap editor creates flags that indicate if tile is flipped horizontally or vertically,
HaxeFlixel does not support these flags.
Make sure no tiles are flipped in TiledMap editor.
Create flipped versions of the tiles instead in your art program.
